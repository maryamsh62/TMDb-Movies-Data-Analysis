## TMDb Movies Data Analysis

In this project, we explore a data set of movies. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from the Movie Database ([TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US)), including user ratings and revenue. **TMDb movie data** cleaned from original data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).

What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success?
This is a great place to start digging in to those questions, with data on the plot, cast, crew, budget, and revenues of several thousand films.

We are going to explore and answer two questions:

1. Which genres are most popular from year to year?

2. What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenue?
